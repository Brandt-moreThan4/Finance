# Scraper

This is a massive work in process, but if you want to follow the code so far, start in the file
 'main---10k_scrape_runner.py'. This kicks off the process for pulling a few financial statements
  and saving them in a local folder for a few sample companies. The bulk of the code is in the file:
  'sec_reports.py'.
  
  This project is far from being complete and needs a lot of work. Stay tuned.
