# Two Projects

1. Project1- Back Tester: For now, the goal is simple. Just create a tool that allows you to take historical stock price information, test some very basic trading strategies on it, then present summary information in the form charts and other performance stats.
    *  But I am not really working on this project right now, so it is not too thought out or developed.
    *  Relevant code is in the ‘Finance/Backtest’ folder on GitHub.
