# Two Projects

1. Project 1: Back Tester: For now, the goal is simple. Just create a tool that allows you to take historical stock price information, test some very basic trading strategies on it, then present summary information in the form charts and other performance stats.
    *  But I am not really working on this project right now, so it is not too thought out or developed.
    *  Relevant code is in the ‘Finance/Backtest’ folder on GitHub.
2. Project 2: SEC Scraper:
    *The broad goal of this project is to scrape SEC website for info in public company’s filings. All sorts of info. And then manipulate it and do fun stuff with it. Not really sure what the fun stuff will be, but perhaps aggregate data from different companies in the same industry and look for stuff that seems interesting.
